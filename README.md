# Proactive Discovery and Mitigation of Security Vulnerabilities Leveraged by Software-Defined Networks

The developed system orchestrates automated vulnerability analysis and mitigation through a Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) platform, using a vulnerability scanner and applying a mitigation measure, demonstrating VLAN switching through the SDN controller, isolating vulnerable devices.

## Design

It was designed a system with the ideas from the previous section in mind to address some of the identified open issues. The next diagram illustrates the main building blocks and workflow that make up the designed system. It begins with the detection phase, in which the system continuously monitors network devices for vulnerabilities, using active probing tools. The vulnerabilities detected are classified using formats such as CVE, which standardizes the information and allows for easier comparison and prioritization. Once the vulnerabilities have been classified, the system moves on to the analysis phase, where the severity and risk associated with each vulnerability are assessed. This analysis helps to determine the most effective mitigation measure. Based on the results, the mitigation phase is triggered, where appropriate mitigation measures are implemented, such as isolating compromised devices through VLAN changes or blocking malicious traffic.

The systemâ€™s architecture has several fundamental components described in the component diagram. It consists of two primary elements: the SOAR Server and the Security Tools Server. The SOAR Server hosts the SOAR Platform, while the Security Tools Server houses essential tools, including the Vulnerability Scanner and the Device Discovery Module.

The Deployment Diagram is represented next. It provides an overview of how the logical components of the system, previously outlined, are deployed. It highlights the distribution of key services and applications, the interactions between them, and the communication protocols that are used. Components represented in blue have been created or their behavior modified.

## Components 

### Catalyst SOAR

The version of Catalyst used in this system was 0.10.3. As this project is constantly being updated and improved, it is advisable to install it following the steps on the website. The OpenAPI code present here will no longer be useful, as Catalyst is now based on PocketBase, replacing much of the logic.

Therefore, the installation steps should be followed via the official Catalyst [Installation Guide](https://catalyst.security-brewery.com/docs/catalyst/admin/install).

### Security Service Adapter

To run the SSA:
```console
$ python3 main.py
```


### Device Discovery Module

The files in the [Device Discovery Module](https://github.com/linuxer1337/sdn-vuln/tree/main/Device%20Discovery) require the installation of the nmap python library and may (or may not) be run in a docker container.

To install python-nmap:
```console
$ pip install python-nmap
```

To run the docker containing nmap:
```console
$ sudo docker run -it ubuntu-nmap:latest
```

### Vulnerability Scanner

If there is an error with the GVM socket you can try: chmod 662 /var/run/gvmd/gvmd.sock


### Ryu SDN Controller

Run SDN Controller docker:
```console
$ sudo docker run -p 6653:6653 -p 8080:8080 -ti --rm my-ryu-image:latest /bin/bash 
```
Launch Ryu:
```console
$ ryu-manager ryu.py
```

If the controller doesn't detect traffic you can try:
```console
$ sudo pkill docker                                                                                                         
sudo iptables -t nat -F
sudo ifconfig docker0 down
sudo brctl delbr docker0
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```


### DHCP Server
